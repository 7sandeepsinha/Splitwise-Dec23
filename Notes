One Way - Two Way Mapping

One-way mapping :
Auditorium Seats

fetch auditorium from DB -> fetch seats for that auditorium
fetch seat from DB -> fetch the auditorium for the seat

As option is more likely, we choose 1way mapping, ie Auditorium has seats

class Auditorium {
    Seat seat;
}

class Seat{
 //does not have auditorium attribute
}

Red Bus
Two Way mapping :
User Booking

User profile -> list of bookings
Booking -> booked by some user

class User {
    Booking booking;
}

class Booking {
    User user;
}

Splitwise
User Group
2way
User -> shows all the groups
Group -> shows all the user

Group Expense
Group -> expense
Expense -> group [ not required ]

Two way mapping often leads to multiple table creation
